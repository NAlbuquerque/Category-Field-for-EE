Author: Nuno Albuquerque [http://www.nainteractive.com]

This field type allows you organize your category groups as you would any other custom field type anywhere on your publish entries form. Additionally a filtered input is provided for long category lists.

Benefits
--------

- Place category groups logically within a publish entries page
- Add instructions for each category group
- Real time input filter (when list contains more than 10 items)
- Categories Edit link is placed directly below each category group vs. the bottom of the categories tab.
- No additional queries performed -- all the action happens on the publish entries form using the DOM
